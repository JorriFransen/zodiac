- Base run wrapper names on filename/line

- Calculate/substitute non leaf constant expressions before emitting bytecode (we only do this when emitting bytecode now).

test
- Containers
  - Hash table
    - Remove
  - Bucket array

- Cleanup builtin types/symbols/atoms
    - Remove builtin type stuff from parser (probably move to type.h and include this)

- Report circular dependency chains (Right now we just emit error for all the unresolved symbols in the chain)

- decls_to_resolve should be a bucket array
- Report the circle when a circular dependency happens
- Report unused return value for call statements
