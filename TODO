- Make parameter declarations act like other declarations (their symbols point to the function decl atm).
- Calculate/substitute non leaf constant expressions before emitting bytecode.
- Initializers for globals should also be constant.

- Containers
  - Hash table
    - Remove
  - Bucket array

- Cleanup builtin types/symbols/atoms
    - Remove builtin type stuff from parser (probably move to type.h and include this)

- Use a actual declaration ast nodes for function parameters. (Instead of the field declaration, which complicates things like redelcarations etc.)
- Report circular dependency chains (Right now we just emit error for all the unresolved symbols in the chain)

- decls_to_resolve should be a bucket array
- Report the circle when a circular dependency happens
- Report unused return value for call statements
