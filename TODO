- AST nodes should use Source_Range instead of source pos (begin/end)

- Containers
  - Hash table
  - Bucket array

- Use a actual declaration ast nodes for function parameters. (Instead of the field declaration, which complicates things like redelcarations etc.)
- Report circular dependency chains (Right now we just emit error for all the unresolved symbols in the chain)

- Cleanup builtin types/symbols/atoms
- decls_to_resolve should be a bucket array
- Report the circle when a circular dependency happens
- Report unused return value for call statements
